# Dynamic Restaurant Homepage

## Overview 

This project uses modular JavaScript to dynamically render the contents of a restaurant website.

In order to implement tabbed browsing across the site's pages (Home/Menu/Contact), each page's content is stored in a separate ES6 module. Tab-switching logic defined in index.js then enables each page to be loaded dynamically when the corresponding tab is clicked.

## Further Details

This site was developed with JavaScript and HTML/CSS, using npm and webpack to automate the build process.

The project is hosted on Github Pages: [Click here](https://jeremy-gleason.github.io/Dynamic-Homepage) to see it live.
